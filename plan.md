## Winter break

## Spring Semester

* **Week 14 - Read papers for related work, write summaries, work on dissertation, consider early stopping algorithm**
* **Week 15 - Look into early stopping procedurs and find real-world graphs to test algorithms on**
* **Week 16 - Begin writing up details of compression techniques in dissertation, locate more large graphs**
* **Week 17 - Develop methods for reading graphs from different file types, discuss implementations/high level overviews of compression algorithms**
* **Week 18 - Finish techniques section, consider developing hybrid approach (combination of approx and exact)**
* **Week 19 - Discuss experiment results for smaller graphs, begin implementations section**
* **Week 20 - Complete background works section, finish running experiments**
* **Week 21 - Discuss experiment results and implementations in detail**
* **Week 22 - Conclude and search for future work opportunities, things that could have been done better, etc, begin work on presentation now that paper is almost complete**
* **Week 23 - Write up abstract, go over details of dissertation to make sure all is correct and in order**
* **Week 24 - Continue going over dissertation to ensure that it is of suitable quality before submission** Dissertation submission deadline and presentations.
